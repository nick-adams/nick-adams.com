      <!-- <h3 class="heading--lg project__heading">My Role</h3>
      <p class="project__body">
        Over the course of 6 months on this project I worked on a team of 5 — myself, the (sole) Designer, 2 Developers, 1 Project Manager, and 1 QA &mdash; to redesign the Hudl iOS app.
      </p> 
      <p class="project__body">
        I was first responsible for working with the team to define the core problem, the desired outcome, and in turn the scope of the project. This started, like almost all projects at Hudl, with user research. 
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p class="project__body">
        This started with business research and user research. That helped define the problem, which the led to design explorations, sketch sessions, and prototyping. From there we landed on a direction and I worked directly with the developers to provide direction on the implementation of the design. Finally, I worked ensure the roll-out was successful through our beta testing program, coordination with our support team, and ultimately measuring results by gathering feedback and data on the real world usage.
      </p>

      <!-- <p class="project__body">
        From there I was responsible for doing initial user research to help understand the core problem and how it was affecting our users, providing us with a clear problem definition. 
      </p>
      <p class="project__body">
        After understanding all of that, I led some group sketch sessions and did design explorations on my own to come up with a new design direction for our app. This became the basis for our prototyping. 
      </p>
      <p class="project__body">
        During prototyping, and eventually the implementation, I worked closely with the developers to make sure the design direction was the right one. This entailed fine visual design details, along with larger conceptual problems that needed to be worked out. We worked in a very tight feedback loop, doing internal and external usability tests along the way.
